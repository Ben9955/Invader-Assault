          <img src="assets/images/gui/boss.gif" alt="Enemy Ship" />
          <h3>Big Boss</h3>
          <p>
            The Eyebeam Overlord is your toughest challenge. It shoots powerful
            beams from its eyes and is incredibly hard to defeat. Only the best
            can bring this alien down.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <img src="assets/images/gui/blob-alien.gif" alt="Boss Alien" />
          <h3>Blob Alien</h3>
          <p>
            Slow but deadly, the Blob Alien explodes on contact with your ship,
            causing severe damage. It can’t shoot, but you’ll need to destroy it
            before it gets too close.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <img src="assets/images/gui/gun-alien.gif" alt="Shield Power-Up" />
          <h3>Gun Alienr</h3>
          <p>
            Armed with a plasma blaster, the Gun Alien fires rapid projectiles
            from a distance. It’s fast and dangerous—take it down before it
            overwhelms you with firepower.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <img src="assets/images/gui/beetlemorph.gif" alt="Laser Upgrade" />
          <h3>Beetlemorph</h3>
          <p>
            Small and numerous, Beetlemorphs can’t shoot but deal minor damage
            if touched. They’re harmless if they reach the bottom of the screen,
            so choose your battles wisely
          </p>
        </div>

          <h3>Asteroid</h3>
          <p>
            Destroying an asteroid earns points, and sometimes a power-up will
            appear in its place. If it collides with the ship, it deals small
            damage.
